What is an Architectural Decision Record?

First, let's talk about an Architectural Decision.

An Architectural Decision (AD) is a software design choice that addresses a functional or non-functional requirement that is architecturally significant. 

An Architecturally Significant Requirement (ASR) is a requirement that has a measurable effect on a software systemâ€™s architecture and quality. 

An Architectural Decision Record (ADR) captures a single AD, such as often done when writing personal notes or meeting minutes; the collection of ADRs created and maintained in a project constitute its decision log. 

All these are within the topic of Architectural Knowledge Management (AKM).
